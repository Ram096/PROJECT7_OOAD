Choice of code language: Java

The purpose of this project is to create a program that can manage and process pizza orders for a pizza store called ‘Dough Masters’. The aim is to provide an efficient and user-friendly system that allows customers to place their pizza orders and the store to manage those orders.
The system will allow customers to view the available pizza options and place their orders online. It will also provide features like product selection and delivery management. Additionally, the system will enable the store to manage the orders efficiently, keep track of inventory, and generate reports to monitor sales and profitability.
The kind of system being built is an online ordering system that can be accessed from github. The system will be built using Java programming language and will likely involve the use of frameworks and libraries for developing web applications.
Overall, the goal of Dough Masters code is to provide a convenient and efficient ordering process for customers and streamline the pizza ordering process for the store.

Since we are planning to develop a pizzeria simulation, having a text file where we store the output of our simulation will be helpful (just like the FNCD simulation). This text file would contain what occurs every day in the pizzeria, from orders being placed to buying more ingredients, to hiring new employees, etc. In order to have a more accurate system that simulates the efficiency of the shop and profits, the system should simulate 30 days. 

In addition, we implemented an app designed in Figma that includes a number of visual elements, including:

    - A home screen or landing page: This would be the first screen users see when they open the app. It might include a prominent header or logo, as well as buttons or links to different parts of the app.

    - A menu screen: This screen would likely include a list of available pizzas, along with prices, descriptions, and images. Users could browse the menu, add items to their cart, and customize their orders as needed.

    - An order screen: Once users have selected the pizzas they want, they would move to an order screen. This might include a summary of the order, along with a form for users to enter their delivery or pickup information.

    - A confirmation screen: Once the order is complete, users would see a confirmation screen that includes details about the order, estimated delivery or pickup time, and any other relevant information.


Overall, we have successfully developed a Java-based pizza ordering and management system for a pizza store. Our project includes various features such as adding and updating pizzas, creating and managing orders, and generating reports. Our system utilizes object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a well-organized and modular codebase.


Here are the steps to run the Java pizza store app in IntelliJ IDEA:

    Open IntelliJ IDEA and open the project containing the pizza store code.
    In the project directory, locate the main class file, which should be named "main.java".
    Right-click on the main class file and select "Run 'main()'". This will run the main method in the PizzaStore class, which starts the pizza store application.
    Alternatively, you can click on the green play button in the top right corner of the IntelliJ IDEA window and select "PizzaStore.main()" from the dropdown menu.
    Once the application is running, you should see a simulator of our pizza store code. From here, you can navigate through the different tasks that our pizza store did during the simulation period.
    

Note that in order to run the app successfully, you'll need to ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies and configurations set up correctly. You may need to configure your IDE or build tool to include any external libraries or packages that the code depends on. Additionally, you may need to set up a database or other external resources that the app relies on.
