# PROJECT6_OOAD
The purpose of this project is to create a program that can manage and process pizza orders for a pizza store called ‘Dough Masters’. The aim is to provide an efficient and user-friendly system that allows customers to place their pizza orders and the store to manage those orders.
The system will allow customers to view the available pizza options and place their orders online. It will also provide features like product selection and delivery management. Additionally, the system will enable the store to manage the orders efficiently, keep track of inventory, and generate reports to monitor sales and profitability.
The kind of system being built is an online ordering system that can be accessed from github. The system will be built using Java programming language and will likely involve the use of frameworks and libraries for developing web applications.
Overall, the goal of Dough Masters code is to provide a convenient and efficient ordering process for customers and streamline the pizza ordering process for the store.
